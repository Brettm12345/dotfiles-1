MPD

These files are here in case I need them. I'm currently using mopidy.

I have my music in `~/usr/music`, organized in subdirectories for each artist,
each with subdirectories for albums.

To get info for panels I use `mpc idle` and `mpc status`. `mpc idle` waits and
does nothing until something happens.
