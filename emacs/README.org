* Emacs
** The ((Lisp)) virtual machine

Emacs, being a full-fledged fully-customizable Lisp virtual machine allows for
and infinite number of workflows and aesthetics.
Some people use emacs as a mail client, music player, irc client and so on.
I prefer to use it just as a programming environment.

The theme I use is [[https://github.com/tudurom/xresources-theme][custom]].
