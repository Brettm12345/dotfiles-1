~~This is my first ever GNU/Linux install on real hardware, and my first rice.~~

~~Feel free to complain about my stupidity!~~

Shiny new HLWM rice with Ruby powered Lemonbar!

Wallpapers README
-----------------

There is a script called `setwall` which sets the wallpaper to `Pictures/wallpaper.png`. If it is 1st of April, then the script sets the wallpaper to `Pictures/april_wall.png`. Also, there is a 1% chance to set your wallpaper to `Pictures/surprise_wall.png`.

You can override this behaviour by setting the `DONGERS` environment variable to `1` to set the wallpaper to `Pictures/april_wall.png` or by setting the `FINGER` env to `1` for the wallpaper with Linus Torvalds.

Happy hacking!
