tudurom's dotfiles
==================

> you are your dotfiles

A mix of style and usability, these are my dotfiles. This repo is structured in a way first-time UNIX users and ricers can understand what's going on, with explications for each directory.

Managing
--------

I manage my dotfiles using GNU Stow. [Here's a neat article about managing your dotfiles with stow](http://blog.xero.nu/managing_dotfiles_with_gnu_stow).

Directory structure
-------------------

Each directory has a `README.md` file.

Backups
-------

In case of fire, my dotfiles are mirrored on a number of servers:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom/dotfiles)
- [notabug](https://notabug.org/tudurom/dotfiles)
- [my server](http://thetudor.ddns.net/git/dotfiles/log.html)
